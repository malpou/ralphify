# Web Dashboard

Ralphify includes a web-based orchestration dashboard that lets you manage
multiple runs, watch iterations in real time, and edit primitives — all from
your browser.

## Install

The dashboard requires optional dependencies:

=== "uv tool (recommended)"

    If you installed ralphify with `uv tool install`, reinstall with the UI extra:

    ```bash
    uv tool install "ralphify[ui]"
    ```

=== "pipx"

    ```bash
    pipx install "ralphify[ui]"
    ```

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install "ralphify[ui]"
    ```

This adds FastAPI, uvicorn, and WebSocket support.

## Launch

```bash
ralph ui
```

The dashboard opens at [http://127.0.0.1:8765](http://127.0.0.1:8765).

| Option    | Default       | Description              |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|
| `--port`  | `8765`        | Port to serve the UI on  |
| `--host`  | `127.0.0.1`   | Host to bind to          |

To expose the dashboard on your network:

```bash
ralph ui --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
```

## Dashboard tabs

The dashboard has four tabs. **Prompts** is the default landing page.

### Prompts

The Prompts tab shows every named prompt discovered in `.ralph/prompts/` as a
card grid. Each card displays:

- **Name** and **description** (from the prompt's frontmatter)
- A **content preview** of the prompt body
- An **Edit** button that opens an inline editor
- A **Run** button that opens the New Run modal with that prompt pre-selected

Use this tab to quickly browse your prompts, start a run from a specific one,
or create new prompts without leaving the browser.

### Timeline

Select a run in the sidebar to see its iterations as they complete:

- Pass/fail status with color-coded badges
- Agent output (truncated to 5,000 characters, same as the CLI)
- Check results with individual pass/fail/timeout indicators
- Duration and return codes

Each check gets a **sparkline bar** showing its pass/fail history across
iterations. Green means pass, red means fail, yellow means timeout — useful for
spotting flaky checks or regressions at a glance.

Events stream over WebSocket, so the page updates without refreshing.

### Configure

The Configure tab lists all checks, contexts, and instructions in your project.
You can:

- View the frontmatter and body of each primitive
- Toggle primitives on and off with enable/disable badges
- Create new primitives
- Edit existing ones
- Delete primitives you no longer need

Changes are written directly to the `.ralph/` directory on disk.

### History

Shows all past runs organized by status — completed, stopped, and failed. Each
run displays its pass rate and iteration count. Click any run to jump to the
Timeline view and see its full iteration details.

## Starting a run

Click **New Run** in the sidebar to open the run modal. It lets you:

- **Pick a named prompt** — cards show every prompt discovered in `.ralph/prompts/`
- **Enter an ad-hoc prompt** — toggle to ad-hoc mode and type a one-off task
- **Configure settings** — expand the settings panel to set max iterations, delay between iterations, timeout, and stop-on-error

Once a run starts, you can **pause**, **resume**, or **stop** it from the
sidebar or the controls bar above the Timeline.

## Editing while a run is active

The dashboard lets you edit primitives via the Configure tab while a run is in progress, but not all changes take effect immediately:

| What you change | When it takes effect |
|---|---|
| `PROMPT.md` content | Next iteration — the prompt is re-read from disk every iteration |
| Context command output | Next iteration — context commands re-run every iteration |
| Check/context/instruction config (frontmatter, body, enable/disable) | After restart — primitive configurations are loaded once when a run starts |
| New or deleted primitives | After restart — primitive discovery happens once at run start |

To apply primitive configuration changes to a running run, **stop** the run and **start a new one**. The new run will discover the updated primitives from disk.

!!! tip "Prompt edits are always live"
    The most common adjustment — adding a constraint or changing the task in your prompt — takes effect on the very next iteration without restarting. This is the primary way to steer the agent in real time.

## Architecture

The dashboard is a single-page app that talks to a FastAPI backend:

```
Browser (Preact + htm)
  ↕ WebSocket (live events)
  ↕ REST API (run management, primitives)
FastAPI (uvicorn)
  ↕ RunManager (threading)
  ↕ run_loop (engine.py)
```

- **Backend**: FastAPI serves the REST API and WebSocket endpoint. Each run
  executes in its own thread using the same `run_loop()` that powers the CLI.
- **Frontend**: A Preact app bundled with esbuild. No build step needed to use
  it — the compiled bundle ships with the package.
- **Events**: The run loop emits structured events (iteration started, check
  passed, check failed, etc.) into a queue. An async task drains the queue and
  broadcasts events to all connected WebSocket clients.

## REST API

The dashboard exposes a REST API you can use to script runs, manage primitives,
and build custom integrations. All examples below assume the dashboard is running
at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.

### Runs

#### Start a new run

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_dir": ".",
    "max_iterations": 5,
    "delay": 2,
    "timeout": 300,
    "stop_on_error": true
  }'
```

The request body accepts these fields:

| Field            | Type          | Default      | Description                                         |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `project_dir`    | string        | `"."`        | Path to the project directory                       |
| `prompt_file`    | string        | `"PROMPT.md"`| Path to the prompt file                             |
| `prompt_text`    | string\|null  | `null`       | Inline prompt text (overrides `prompt_file`)        |
| `prompt_name`    | string\|null  | `null`       | Named prompt to use from `.ralph/prompts/`          |
| `command`        | string\|null  | `null`       | Agent command (reads from `ralph.toml` if omitted)  |
| `args`           | list\|null    | `null`       | Agent arguments (reads from `ralph.toml` if omitted)|
| `max_iterations` | int\|null     | `null`       | Max iterations (`null` = unlimited)                 |
| `delay`          | float         | `0`          | Seconds to wait between iterations                  |
| `timeout`        | float\|null   | `null`       | Seconds before killing a stuck iteration            |
| `stop_on_error`  | bool          | `false`      | Stop the loop if the agent exits non-zero           |
| `log_dir`        | string\|null  | `null`       | Directory to save iteration logs                    |

Response:

```json
{
  "run_id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "status": "running",
  "iteration": 0,
  "completed": 0,
  "failed": 0,
  "timed_out": 0
}
```

You can provide a prompt three ways — pick one:

- **`prompt_file`** — path to a markdown file (default: reads `PROMPT.md`)
- **`prompt_text`** — raw prompt string passed inline
- **`prompt_name`** — name of a prompt in `.ralph/prompts/`

#### List all runs

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/runs
```

```json
[
  {
    "run_id": "a1b2c3d4",
    "status": "running",
    "iteration": 3,
    "completed": 2,
    "failed": 1,
    "timed_out": 0
  }
]
```

#### Get run details

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/runs/a1b2c3d4
```

Returns the same shape as the list response, for a single run.

#### Pause, resume, and stop

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/runs/a1b2c3d4/pause
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/runs/a1b2c3d4/resume
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/runs/a1b2c3d4/stop
```

All three return the updated run status.

#### Update settings mid-run

Change runtime settings without restarting:

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/runs/a1b2c3d4/settings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"max_iterations": 10, "delay": 5}'
```

All fields are optional — only the ones you include are updated:

| Field            | Type         | Description                           |
|------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| `max_iterations` | int\|null    | New iteration limit                   |
| `delay`          | float\|null  | New delay between iterations          |
| `timeout`        | float\|null  | New timeout per iteration             |
| `stop_on_error`  | bool\|null   | Whether to stop on agent errors       |

### Primitives

Primitive endpoints use a base64-encoded `project_dir` in the URL path. Encode
it with:

```bash
PROJECT=$(echo -n "/path/to/project" | base64)
```

#### List all primitives

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/projects/$PROJECT/primitives
```

```json
[
  {
    "kind": "checks",
    "name": "tests",
    "enabled": true,
    "content": "Fix all failing tests.",
    "frontmatter": {"command": "uv run pytest -x", "timeout": 120, "enabled": true}
  },
  {
    "kind": "contexts",
    "name": "git-log",
    "enabled": true,
    "content": "## Recent commits",
    "frontmatter": {"command": "git log --oneline -10", "timeout": 10, "enabled": true}
  }
]
```

#### Get a specific primitive

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/projects/$PROJECT/primitives/checks/tests
```

#### Create a new primitive

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/projects/$PROJECT/primitives/checks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Fix all type errors.",
    "frontmatter": {
      "name": "typecheck",
      "command": "uv run mypy src/",
      "timeout": 60,
      "enabled": true
    }
  }'
```

The `name` field in `frontmatter` is required — it determines the directory name
under `.ralph/checks/typecheck/CHECK.md`.

#### Update a primitive

```bash
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/projects/$PROJECT/primitives/checks/tests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Fix all failing tests. Do not skip or delete tests.",
    "frontmatter": {"command": "uv run pytest -x", "timeout": 180, "enabled": true}
  }'
```

#### Delete a primitive

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/projects/$PROJECT/primitives/checks/typecheck
```

Returns `204 No Content` on success.

### WebSocket

Connect to `/api/ws` for live event streaming:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8765/api/ws");

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log(data.type, data.run_id, data.data);
};
```

Events are JSON objects with this shape:

```json
{
  "type": "iteration_start",
  "run_id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-11T14:23:01.123456",
  "data": { }
}
```

You can filter events by run ID:

```javascript
ws.send(JSON.stringify({ "action": "subscribe", "run_id": "a1b2c3d4" }));
```

Send `{"action": "subscribe", "run_id": "*"}` to receive events from all runs
(this is the default on connect).
